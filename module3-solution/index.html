                Raw chicken may contain Salmonella. The safe minimum cooking temperature recommended by the
                U.S. Department of Health & Human Services is 165 °F (74 °C) to prevent foodborne illness
                because of bacteria and parasites.[31] However, in Japan raw chicken is sometimes consumed
                in a dish called torisashi, which is sliced raw chicken served in sashimi style. Another
                preparation is toriwasa which is lightly seared on the outsides while the inside remains
                raw.[32]

                Chicken can be cooked in many ways. It can be made into sausages, skewered, put in salads,
                traditionally grilled or by using electric grill, breaded and deep-fried, or used in various
                curries. There is significant variation in cooking methods amongst cultures. Historically
                common methods include roasting, baking, broasting, and frying. Western cuisine frequently
                has chicken prepared by deep frying for fast foods such as fried chicken, chicken nuggets,
                chicken lollipops or Buffalo wings. They are also often grilled for salads or tacos.

                Chickens often come with labels such as "roaster", which suggest a method of cooking based
                on the type of chicken. While these labels are only suggestions, ones labeled for stew often
                do not do well when cooked with other methods.[33]

                Some chicken breast cuts and processed chicken breast products include the moniker "with rib
                meat". This is a misnomer, as it refers to the small piece of white meat that overlays the
                scapula, removed along with the breast meat. The breast is cut from the chicken and sold as
                a solid cut, while the leftover breast and true rib meat is stripped from the bone through
                mechanical separation for use in chicken franks, for example. Breast meat is often sliced
                thinly and marketed as chicken slices, an easy filling for sandwiches. Often, the tenderloin
                (pectoralis minor) is marketed separately from the breast (pectoralis major). In the US,
                "tenders" can be either tenderloins or strips cut from the breast. In the UK the strips of
                pectoralis minor are called "chicken mini-fillets".

                Chicken bones are hazardous to health as they tend to break into sharp splinters when eaten,
                but they can be simmered with vegetables and herbs for hours or even days to make chicken
                stock.

                In Asian countries it is possible to buy bones alone as they are very popular for making
                chicken soups, which are said to be healthy. In Australia the rib cages and backs of
                chickens after the other cuts have been removed are frequently sold cheaply in supermarket
                delicatessen sections as either "chicken frames" or "chicken carcasses" and are purchased
                for soup or stock purposes.

                <h3 class="text-center"><b>Beef</b></h3>
                Most beef skeletal muscle meat can be used as is by merely cutting into certain parts, such as roasts,
                short ribs or steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak,
                etc.), while other cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky). Trimmings, on the other hand, are
                usually mixed with meat from older, leaner (therefore tougher) cattle, are ground, minced or used in
                sausages. The blood is used in some varieties called blood sausage. Other parts that are eaten include
                other muscles and offal, such as the oxtail, liver, tongue, tripe from the reticulum or rumen, glands
                (particularly the pancreas and thymus, referred to as sweetbread), the heart, the brain (although
                forbidden where there is a danger of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE, commonly referred to as mad
                cow disease), the kidneys, and the tender testicles of the bull (known in the United States as calf
                fries, prairie oysters, or Rocky Mountain oysters). Some intestines are cooked and eaten as is,[3] but
                are more often cleaned and used as natural sausage casings. The bones are used for making beef stock.
                Meat from younger cows (calves) is called veal.

                Beef from steers and heifers is similar.[4] Depending on economics, the number of heifers kept for
                breeding varies. The meat from older bulls, because it is usually tougher, is frequently used for mince
                (known as ground beef in the United States). Cattle raised for beef may be allowed to roam free on
                grasslands, or may be confined at some stage in pens as part of a large feeding operation called a
                feedlot (or concentrated animal feeding operation), where they are usually fed a ration of grain,
                protein, roughage and a vitamin/mineral preblend.

                Beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world, accounting for about 25% of meat production
                worldwide, after pork and poultry at 38% and 30% respectively.[5] In absolute numbers, the United
                States, Brazil, and the People's Republic of China are the world's three largest consumers of beef;
                Uruguay, however, has the highest beef and veal consumption per capita, followed by Argentina and
                Brazil. According to the data from OECD, the average Uruguayan ate over 42 kg (93 lb) of beef or veal in
                2014, representing the highest beef/veal consumption per capita in the world. In comparison, the average
                American consumed only about 24 kg (53 lb) beef or veal in the same year, while African countries, such
                as Mozambique, Ghana, and Nigeria, consumed the least beef or veal per capita.

                In 2018, the United States, Brazil, and China produced the most beef with 12.22 million tons, 9.9
                million tons, and 6.46 million tons respectively.[6] The top 3 beef exporting countries in 2019 were
                Australia (14.8% of total exports), the United States (13.4% of total exports), and Brazil (12.6% of
                total exports).[7] Beef production is also important to the economies of Japan, Argentina, Uruguay,
                Canada, Paraguay, Mexico, Belarus and Nicaragua.

                <h3 class="text-center"><b>Shushi</b></h3>
                Sushi originates in a Southeast Asian dish, known as narezushi (馴れ寿司, 熟寿司 – "salted fish"), stored in
                fermented rice for possibly months at a time. The lacto-fermentation of the rice prevented the fish from
                spoiling;[3] the rice would be discarded before consumption of the fish.[4] This early type of sushi
                became an important source of protein for its Japanese consumers. The term sushi literally means
                "sour-tasting" and comes from an antiquated し (shi) terminal-form conjugation, 酸し sushi, no longer used
                in other contexts, of the adjectival verb 酸い sui "to be sour";[5] the overall dish has a sour and umami
                or savoury taste.[6] Narezushi still exists as a regional specialty, notably as funa-zushi from Shiga
                Prefecture.[7]


                Osaka-style sushi, also called "Oshi-zushi" or "hako-sushi"
                Vinegar began to be added to the preparation of narezushi in the Muromachi period (1336–1573) for the
                sake of enhancing both taste and preservation. In addition to increasing the sourness of the rice, the
                vinegar significantly increased the dish's longevity, causing the fermentation process to be shortened
                and eventually abandoned. The primitive sushi would be further developed in Osaka, where over several
                centuries it became oshi-zushi or "hako-zushi"; in this preparation, the seafood and rice were pressed
                into shape with wooden (typically bamboo) molds.

                It was not until the Edo period (1603–1868) that fresh fish was served over vinegared rice and nori. The
                particular style of today's nigirizushi became popular in Edo (contemporary Tokyo) in the 1820s or
                1830s. One common story of nigirizushi's origins is of the chef Hanaya Yohei (1799–1858), who invented
                or perfected the technique in 1824 at his shop in Ryōgoku.[7] The dish was originally termed Edomae
                zushi as it used freshly caught fish from the Edo-mae (Edo or Tokyo Bay); the term Edomae nigirizushi is
                still used today as a by-word for quality sushi, regardless of its ingredients' origins.[8][9]

                The earliest written mention of sushi in English described in the Oxford English Dictionary is in an
                1893 book, A Japanese Interior, where it mentions sushi as "a roll of cold rice with fish, sea-weed, or
                some other flavoring".[10][11] There is an earlier mention of sushi in James Hepburn's Japanese-English
                dictionary from 1873,[12] and an 1879 article on Japanese cookery in the journal Notes and Queries.[13]
