                Raw chicken may contain Salmonella. The safe minimum cooking temperature recommended by the
                U.S. Department of Health & Human Services is 165 °F (74 °C) to prevent foodborne illness
                because of bacteria and parasites.[31] However, in Japan raw chicken is sometimes consumed
                in a dish called torisashi, which is sliced raw chicken served in sashimi style. Another
                preparation is toriwasa which is lightly seared on the outsides while the inside remains
                raw.[32]

                Chicken can be cooked in many ways. It can be made into sausages, skewered, put in salads,
                traditionally grilled or by using electric grill, breaded and deep-fried, or used in various
                curries. There is significant variation in cooking methods amongst cultures. Historically
                common methods include roasting, baking, broasting, and frying. Western cuisine frequently
                has chicken prepared by deep frying for fast foods such as fried chicken, chicken nuggets,
                chicken lollipops or Buffalo wings. They are also often grilled for salads or tacos.

                Chickens often come with labels such as "roaster", which suggest a method of cooking based
                on the type of chicken. While these labels are only suggestions, ones labeled for stew often
                do not do well when cooked with other methods.[33]

                Some chicken breast cuts and processed chicken breast products include the moniker "with rib
                meat". This is a misnomer, as it refers to the small piece of white meat that overlays the
                scapula, removed along with the breast meat. The breast is cut from the chicken and sold as
                a solid cut, while the leftover breast and true rib meat is stripped from the bone through
                mechanical separation for use in chicken franks, for example. Breast meat is often sliced
                thinly and marketed as chicken slices, an easy filling for sandwiches. Often, the tenderloin
                (pectoralis minor) is marketed separately from the breast (pectoralis major). In the US,
                "tenders" can be either tenderloins or strips cut from the breast. In the UK the strips of
                pectoralis minor are called "chicken mini-fillets".

                Chicken bones are hazardous to health as they tend to break into sharp splinters when eaten,
                but they can be simmered with vegetables and herbs for hours or even days to make chicken
                stock.

                In Asian countries it is possible to buy bones alone as they are very popular for making
                chicken soups, which are said to be healthy. In Australia the rib cages and backs of
                chickens after the other cuts have been removed are frequently sold cheaply in supermarket
                delicatessen sections as either "chicken frames" or "chicken carcasses" and are purchased
                for soup or stock purposes.
